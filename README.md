# Design_Portfolio_Boards
An extra project after Term 4's final assignments in December. We were given a week to create any website we can think of.

This is a website to showcase my folio boards from Design class in year 12-13.

I learn a lot from making this website:
- <map> tag;
- .zoom class;
- .modal class, and;
- using jQuery plugins

It was an interesting experience, and I'm quite proud of this :D
Hopefully I can learn more in the future and add more to the website!
